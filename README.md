# 📊 Data Analytics & Commercial Insights Case Study

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of a **data analytics job simulation** focused on generating **customer and commercial insights** using retail transaction datasets. The objective was to analyze customer behavior, segment shoppers, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to support category management and strategic business decisions.

---

## 🎯 Business Task

* Perform data preparation, cleaning, and transformation for analysis.
* Conduct customer and product segmentation (by lifestage, affluence, brand, and pack size).
* Identify behavioral differences between customer groups.
* Run uplift testing by comparing trial vs. control stores to evaluate intervention effectiveness.
* Deliver actionable insights and recommendations for commercial strategy.

---

## 📂 Data Sources

* Transaction datasets (retail sales)
* Store-level performance data (trial vs. control stores)
* Category review data for Chips

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills

* **Python / R** for data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization
* **Pandas, NumPy, tidyverse** for data preparation
* **Matplotlib, ggplot2** for visualizations
* **Retail analytics techniques**: customer segmentation, benchmark analysis, uplift testing
* **Business insight generation & reporting**

---

## 🔄 Process

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removed non-relevant products (e.g., salsa).
   * Filtered bulk buyers (200+ packets per transaction).
   * Extracted brand and pack size from product names.

2. **Customer Segmentation**

   * Grouped by **Lifestage** (Young Singles, Families, Older Families, etc.).
   * Classified by **Affluence** (Budget, Mainstream, Premium).

3. **Analysis**

   * Examined revenue contribution, units per customer, and average price per unit.
   * Compared casual vs. frequent buyers across segments.
   * Identified differences between trial stores and matched control stores.

4. **Uplift Testing**

   * Selected control stores based on pre-trial similarity (revenue, customers, transactions).
   * Compared trial vs. control performance from Feb 2019 onward.
   * Measured effectiveness of trial store interventions.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**

   * Budget families purchase higher chip volumes → affordability-driven.
   * Premium customers purchase less → may prefer healthier alternatives.
   * Mainstream Singles/Couples pay slightly higher average prices → occasional premium choices.
   * Trial stores 77 & 86 aligned well with controls → useful for impact measurement.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* **Families** (Older & Young) drive higher unit sales due to bulk consumption.
* **Mainstream Singles/Couples** contribute the largest share to chip sales.
* **Trial interventions** showed impact when measured against well-matched control stores.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. Target **Budget Families** with value-pack promotions.
2. Position **premium chip brands** toward Mainstream Singles/Couples who are willing to pay slightly more.
3. Introduce **healthier chip alternatives** to attract Premium customers.
4. Continue uplift testing with control stores for accurate measurement of interventions.

---

## 📤 Deliverables

* **Analysis scripts** (data cleaning, segmentation, analysis)
* **Visualizations** (customer segmentation, trial vs. control performance)
* **Executive Summary Report (PDF)** with insights and recommendations
* **Presentation deck** for stakeholders

---

✅ This case study demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics skills** including data cleaning, customer segmentation, uplift testing, visualization, and generating actionable commercial insights for decision-making.

Would you like me to make a **shortened version (2–3 sections only)** for a clean GitHub **README.md** file, or keep this **detailed structure** (better for case study documentation)?
